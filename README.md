MSc Thesis
-------------------
This is the GitHub repository of my MSc thesis in Datascience: Business and Governance.

The aim of the present thesis is to predict a vessel’s type[1] using historic vessel navigation data and using a supervised learning approach. This historic navigation data used in this thesis was generated by vessels’ *Automatic Identification System* (AIS) which broadcast identification and navigation data.

More to come soon. :)
